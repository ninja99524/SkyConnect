# SkyConnect

SkyConnect is a decentralized connectivity infrastructure project, designed to provide free or low-cost internet access to underserved and remote regions. It combines mesh networking, satellite backhaul, and Filecoin/IPFS storage for network state and anonymized usage metrics.

## Vision
Empower communities with resilient connectivity that is:  
- **Decentralized**: no reliance on a single provider  
- **Transparent**: leveraging open source tools and Filecoin/IPFS for durability  
- **Inclusive**: focused on areas with limited access to affordable connectivity
